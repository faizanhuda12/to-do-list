# to-do-list


In this project I use my knowledge of MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, EJS and CSS to make a To-do-list web application. This web app has a simple easy to use UI that allows the user to add an item they have to do or to remove an item that they have done. This lets the user tracks what they have to do. The app is connected to a Mongo database that stores what the user has to do. EJS templating was used to make it easier to right code and to avoid repeatness in the code.
